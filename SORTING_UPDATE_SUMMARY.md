# Sorting Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to display recently added Roles and Departments first in the Employee Task Management System.

## Changes Made

### 1. Roles Dashboard ([RolesDashboard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/components/dashboard/RolesDashboard.tsx))

Modified the role loading logic to sort custom roles by creation date, with the newest roles appearing first:

```typescript
// Calculate role statistics for custom roles
const customStats: RoleStats[] = loadedCustomRoles
  .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime()) // Sort by creation date (newest first)
  .map(customRole => {
    const roleUsers = allUsers.filter(u => u.role === customRole.name);
    return {
      role: customRole.name,
      count: roleUsers.length,
      users: roleUsers,
      color: `text-${customRole.color}-600`,
      bgColor: customRole.bgColor,
      description: customRole.description,
      isCustom: true,
      customRoleData: customRole, // Include the full custom role data
    };
  });

// Combine built-in and custom roles, with custom roles appearing first
setRoleStats([...customStats, ...builtInStats]);
```

### 2. Departments Component ([Departments.tsx](file:///c:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/components/departments/Departments.tsx))

Modified the department loading logic to sort departments by timestamp, with the newest departments appearing first:

```typescript
console.log('ðŸ“ˆ Final departments with stats:', stats);

// Sort departments by creation timestamp (newest first)
const sortedStats = stats.sort((a, b) => {
  // If timestamp exists, sort by timestamp (newest first)
  if (a.timestamp && b.timestamp) {
    return new Date(b.timestamp).getTime() - new Date(a.timestamp).getTime();
  }
  // If only one has timestamp, prioritize it
  if (a.timestamp && !b.timestamp) return -1;
  if (!a.timestamp && b.timestamp) return 1;
  // If neither has timestamp, maintain original order
  return 0;
});

setDepartmentsWithStats(sortedStats);
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can now easily see recently created roles and departments at the top of the lists
2. **Better Organization**: The interface feels more intuitive as recently added items are prioritized
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Both Roles and Departments now follow the same sorting pattern
4. **Graceful Handling**: Items without timestamps are handled gracefully without breaking the sorting

## Testing

Created and ran tests that confirm:
- âœ… Roles are sorted by creation date (newest first)
- âœ… Departments are sorted by timestamp (newest first)
- âœ… Items without timestamps are handled gracefully
- âœ… Recently added items appear first in both Roles and Departments

## Verification

The changes have been verified through:
1. Code implementation following best practices
2. Test scripts that validate the sorting logic
3. Manual inspection of the updated components

The sorting update is now complete and ready for use.
