# Role API Functionality Removal

## Overview
This document summarizes the removal of Role API functionality from the Employee Task Management System. All role management is now handled locally through localStorage.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Service (`services/apiService.ts`)
- Removed all role-related interfaces:
  - `CustomRole`
  - `RoleCreatePayload`
  - `RoleUpdatePayload`
- Removed all role API endpoints configuration
- Removed authentication configuration for role APIs
- Removed all role API methods:
  - `configureRoleAPIAuth()`
  - `enableRoleAPI()`
  - `tryRoleEndpoints()`
  - `testCORS()`
  - `testRoleAPI()`
  - `createRole()`
  - `getRoles()`
  - `updateRole()`
  - `deleteRole()`
  - `getRoleById()`
  - `searchRoles()`

### 2. Roles Dashboard (`components/dashboard/RolesDashboard.tsx`)
- Removed all API-related state variables
- Removed all API authentication functionality
- Removed role creation, editing, and deletion features
- Simplified dashboard to only display built-in roles
- Removed API connection status indicators
- Removed all modals related to role management

### 3. Utility Scripts
- Removed all role API testing and debugging utilities:
  - `utils/checkRoleAPIStatus.js`
  - `utils/comprehensiveRoleAPITest.js`
  - `utils/corsDebugger.js`
  - `utils/testRoleAPI.js`
  - `utils/testRoleEndpoints.js`

## Current Functionality
The Roles Dashboard now only displays built-in system roles (Admin, Manager, Employee, HR, Parent) and their user distributions. All custom role functionality has been removed.

## Future Considerations
If role API functionality is needed in the future, it would need to be reimplemented from scratch.
