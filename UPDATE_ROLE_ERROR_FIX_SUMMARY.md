# Update Role Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The update role functionality was failing due to inconsistent endpoint URLs across different files in the codebase. The Roles Dashboard was attempting to update roles through the API, but the endpoint configuration was incorrect, leading to failed API calls.

## Root Cause
1. **Inconsistent Endpoint Configuration**: Different files were using different endpoint URLs for the role API
2. **Outdated Documentation**: Several documentation and test files referenced old endpoint URLs
3. **Mismatch Between Code and Documentation**: The actual API service implementation didn't match what was documented

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated API Service Files
- **[services/apiService.ts](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.ts)**: Updated the edit endpoint to use the correct base URL
- **[services/apiService.browser.js](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.browser.js)**: Updated the edit endpoint to use the correct base URL

### 2. Updated Documentation Files
- **[EDIT_ROLES_API_INTEGRATION_COMPLETED.md](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/EDIT_ROLES_API_INTEGRATION_COMPLETED.md)**: Updated endpoint references
- **[NEW_EDIT_ROLES_ENDPOINT_INTEGRATION.md](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/NEW_EDIT_ROLES_ENDPOINT_INTEGRATION.md)**: Updated endpoint references
- **[NEW_ENDPOINT_INTEGRATION.md](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/NEW_ENDPOINT_INTEGRATION.md)**: Updated endpoint references
- **[CORS_FIX_SUMMARY.md](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/CORS_FIX_SUMMARY.md)**: Fixed endpoint configuration inconsistency

### 3. Updated Test Files
- **[test-edit-role-api.js](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/test-edit-role-api.js)**: Updated endpoint references
- **[verify-api-integration.js](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/verify-api-integration.js)**: Updated endpoint references
- **[verify-update-role-fix.js](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/verify-update-role-fix.js)**: Updated endpoint references
- **[verify-update-role-fix.mjs](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/verify-update-role-fix.mjs)**: Updated endpoint references

## Technical Details

### Correct Endpoint Configuration
The role API endpoints are now consistently configured as:
- **Create**: `https://8sg1s897of.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/Create-Roles`
- **Get**: `https://g1ehh7sva6.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/Get-Roles`
- **Edit**: `https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod` (Base URL)
- **Delete**: `https://jjuzlm7x67.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/Delete-Roles`

When updating a role, the full endpoint is constructed by appending the role ID to the edit base URL:
`https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/{roleId}`

### Consistency Between API Service Versions
Both the TypeScript ([apiService.ts](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.ts)) and JavaScript ([apiService.browser.js](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.browser.js)) versions now use the same endpoint configuration approach:
1. Define base URLs for each operation
2. Construct full endpoints by appending operation-specific paths and parameters
3. Maintain consistent error handling and logging

## Verification
The fix has been verified by:
1. Ensuring all endpoint references across the codebase are consistent
2. Confirming the API service implementations match the documented approach
3. Verifying that test files use the correct endpoint URLs

## Impact
This fix resolves the update role error by ensuring:
1. Consistent endpoint URLs across all files
2. Proper endpoint construction for role update operations
3. Accurate documentation and test files
4. Improved reliability of the role management functionality

The Roles Dashboard should now be able to successfully update custom roles through the API without endpoint-related errors.
