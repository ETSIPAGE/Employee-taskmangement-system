# New Edit-Roles Endpoint Integration Summary

## Integration Details

The new AWS API Gateway Edit-Roles endpoint `https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod` has been successfully integrated into the API service.

## Files Updated

1. **[services/apiService.ts](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.ts)** - Updated edit role API endpoint to use the new URL
2. **[services/apiService.browser.js](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.browser.js)** - Updated edit role API endpoint to use the new URL

## Endpoint Configuration

The edit role API endpoint has been updated to:
`https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod`

Individual role updates will use:
`https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/{id}`

## Verification

Created and ran test script [verify-new-edit-endpoint.cjs](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/verify-new-edit-endpoint.cjs) to verify:
- ✅ Main API service has the new edit endpoint configured correctly
- ✅ Browser API service has the new edit endpoint configured correctly
- ✅ Both updateRole methods use correct endpoint construction with role ID

## Impact

The update roles functionality in the Roles Dashboard should now use the new Edit-Roles API endpoint. This integration ensures:
- Proper routing to the new AWS API Gateway Edit-Roles endpoint
- Continued functionality of role update operations
- Consistent endpoint usage across both TypeScript and browser versions

The update roles API should now work properly with the new endpoint configuration.
