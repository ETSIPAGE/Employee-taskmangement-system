# New Endpoint Integration Summary

## Integration Details

The new AWS API Gateway invoke URL `https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod` has been successfully integrated into the API service.

## Files Updated

1. **[services/apiService.ts](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.ts)** - Updated all role API endpoints to use the new base URL
2. **[services/apiService.browser.js](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.browser.js)** - Updated all role API endpoints to use the new base URL

## Endpoints Configured

All role API endpoints have been updated to use the new base URL:

- **Create Roles**: `https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/Create-Roles`
- **Get Roles**: `https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/Get-Roles`
- **Edit Roles**: `https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod`
- **Delete Roles**: `https://xo3txgkwkb.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/Delete-Roles`

## Verification

Created and ran test script [test-new-endpoint.cjs](file:///C:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/test-new-endpoint.cjs) to verify:
- ✅ Main API service has the new endpoint configured correctly
- ✅ Browser API service has the new endpoint configured correctly
- ✅ All role endpoints (create, get, edit, delete) are using the new base URL

## Impact

The Roles Dashboard and all role management functionality should now use the new API endpoints. This integration ensures:
- Consistent API endpoint usage across both TypeScript and browser versions
- Proper routing to the new AWS API Gateway
- Continued functionality of all role management operations (create, read, update, delete)

The update roles API should now work properly with the new endpoint configuration.
