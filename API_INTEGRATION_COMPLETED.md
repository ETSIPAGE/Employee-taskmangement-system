# API Integration Completed âœ…

## Summary
The integration with the new company API endpoint `https://3dgtvtdri1.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/get/get-com` has been successfully completed.

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated API Service Files
- **services/apiService.ts**: Updated the [getCompanies](file:///c:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.ts#L149-L197) method to use the new endpoint URL
- **services/apiService.browser.js**: Added the [getCompanies](file:///c:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.ts#L149-L197) method to the browser-compatible version

### 2. Verified Integration
- Created and ran a test script that successfully connected to the new API endpoint
- Confirmed the API returns data in the expected format
- Verified the response contains company information including ID, name, and creation details

### 3. Created Testing Resources
- **test-api-integration.cjs**: Node.js script to test the API directly
- **verify-integration.html**: Browser-based test page with UI
- **server.js**: Simple HTTP server to serve the test files
- **start-server.bat**: Windows batch file to easily start the server

### 4. Documentation
- **INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md**: Technical summary of changes
- **README-API-INTEGRATION.md**: Detailed guide for testing and troubleshooting
- **API_INTEGRATION_COMPLETED.md**: This file (final summary)

## Integration Details
The new API returns company data in this format:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "c25495e2-b69e-4d31-890b-92730ea360da",
    "name": "Drone",
    "createdBy": "1756363695034",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-17T10:59:45.370Z",
    // ... additional fields
  }
]
```

Our API service correctly maps this data to the Company interface used throughout the application.

## How to Test
1. **Command Line Test**:
   ```
   node test-api-integration.cjs
   ```

2. **Browser Test**:
   - Run `start-server.bat`
   - Open `http://localhost:3000/verify-integration.html`
   - Click "Test API Integration"

## Impact
The Companies page and any other components that use the [getCompanies](file:///c:/Users/Hi/Desktop/ETS/Employee-taskmangement-system/services/apiService.ts#L149-L197) method will now fetch data from the new API endpoint instead of the old one or local storage.

## Next Steps
No further action is required. The integration is complete and working. The application will automatically use the new endpoint when fetching company data.
